A for loop repeats commands once for every thing in a list.

Every for loop needs a variable to refer to the thing it is currently operating on.

Use $name to expand a variable (i.e., get its value). ${name} can also be used.

Do not use spaces, quotes, or wildcard characters such as ‘*’ or ‘?’ in filenames, as it complicates variable expansion.

Give files consistent names that are easy to match with wildcard patterns to make it easy to select them for looping.

Use the up-arrow key to scroll up through previous commands to edit and repeat them.

Use Ctrl+R to search through the previously entered commands.

Use history to display recent commands, and ![number] to repeat a command by number
